# Attribute Directives - Overview
There are three kinds of directives in `Angular`:
  1. Components: directives with a template
  2. Structural directives: change the `DOM` layout by adding and removing `DOM` elements
  3. Attribute directives: change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive

_Components_ are the most-common of the three directives.

_Structural directives_ change the structure of the view.  Two examples are `NgFor` and `NgIf`.

_Attribute directives_ are used as attributes of elements.  The built-in `NgStyle` directive in the [Template Syntax](https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax) guide, for example, can change several element styles at the same time.
