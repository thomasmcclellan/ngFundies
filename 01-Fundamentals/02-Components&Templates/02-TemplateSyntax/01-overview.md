# Template Syntax - Overview
The `Angular` application manages what the user sees and can do, achieving this through the interaction of a component class instance (the _component_) and its user-facing template.

You may be familiar with the component/template duality from your experiance with model-view-controller (MVC) or model-view-viewmodel (MVVM).  In `Angular`, the component plays the part of the controller/viewmodel, and the template represents the view.

This section is a comprehensive technical reference to the `Angular` template language.  It explains basic principles of the template language and describes most of the syntax that you'll encounter elsewhere in the documentation.
