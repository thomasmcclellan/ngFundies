# The `RxJS` Library - Overview
[Reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change.  [`RxJS` (Reactive Extensions for `JS`)](https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview) is a library for reactive programming using `observables` that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.

`RxJS` provides an implementation of the `Observable` type, which is needed until the type becomes part of the language and until browsers support it.  The library also provides utility `functions` for creating and working with `observables`.  These utility `functions` can be used for:
  * Converting existing code for async operations into `observables`
  * Iterating through the values in a stream
  * Mapping values to different types
  * Filtering streams
  * Composing multiple streams
