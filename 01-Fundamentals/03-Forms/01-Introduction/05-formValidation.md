# Forms Introduction - Form Validation
Validation is an integral part of managing any set of forms.  Whether you're checking for required fields or querying an external API for an existing username, `Angular` provides a set of built-in validators as well as the ability to create custom validators.
  * **Reactive forms** define custom validators as `functions` that receive a control to validate
  * **Template-driven forms** are tied to template **directives**, and must provide custom validator directives that wrap validation `functions`
