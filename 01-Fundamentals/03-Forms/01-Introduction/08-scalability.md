# Forms Introduction - Scalability
In forms are a central part of your application, scalability is very important.  Being able to reuse form models across components is critical.
  * **Reactive forms** provide access to low-level APIs and synchronous access to the form model, creating large-scale forms easier
  * **Template-driven forms** also surface in testing, where testing reactive forms require less setup and no dependencies  on the change detection cycle when updating and validating the form and data models during testing.
