# Forms Introduction - Final Thoughts
Choosing a strategy begins with understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the options presented.  Low-level API and form model access, predictability, mutability, straightforward validation and testing strategies, and scalability are all important considerations in choosing the infrastructure you use to build your forms in `Angular`.  Template-driven forms are similar to patterns in `AngularJS`, but they have limitations given the criteria of many modern, large-scale `Angular` apps.  Reactive forms minimize these limitations.  Reactive forms integrate with reactive patterns already present in other areas of the `Angular` architecture, and complement those requirements well.
