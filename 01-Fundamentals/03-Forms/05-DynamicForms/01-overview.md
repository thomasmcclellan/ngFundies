# Dynamic Forms - Overview
Building handcrafted forms can be costly and time-consuming, especially if you need a great number of them, they're similar to each other, and they change frequently to meet rapidly changing business and regulatory requirements.

It may be more economical to create the form dynamically, based on metadata that describes the business object model.

This cookbook shows you how to use `formGroup` to dynamically render a simple form with different control types and validation. It's a primitive start.  It might evolve to support a much richer variety of questions, more graceful rendering, and superior user experience.  All such greatness has humble beginnings.

The example of this cookbook is a dynamic form to build an online application experience for heroes seeking employment.  The agency is constantly tinkering with the application process.  You can create the form on the fly _without changing the application code_.
