# Entry Components - Overview
An entry component is any component that `Angular` loads imperatively, (which means you're not referencing it in the template), by type. You specify an entry component by bootstrapping it in an `NgModule`, or including it in a routing definition.

  > To contrast the two types of components, there are components which are included in the template, which are declarative. Additionally, there are components which you load imperatively; that is, entry components.

There are two main kinds of entry components:
  * The bootstrapped root component.
  * A component you specify in a route definition.
